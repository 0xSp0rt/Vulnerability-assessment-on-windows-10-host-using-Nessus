<h1>Vulnerability assessment on windows 10 host using Nessus</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project provides a guide on how to conduct uncredentialed and credentialed vulnerability assessment on a windows 10 host using Nessus essentials. Nessus is a vulnerability scanner used to scan for vulnerabilities in devices, operating systems, applications, cloud services and other network resources. The difference between a credentialed and uncredentialed vulnerability scan is the level of detail and in-depth vulnerability analysis provided by a credentialed scan. It is important to conduct these vulnerability scans as often as possible to detect and patch any new vulnerability that may exist.

<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> 
- <b>Nessus essentials</b>


<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
Go to Tenable website and download Nessus for Windows host:   <br/>

<br />
<br />
After installation, Nessus will open a tab on your browser with an insecure connection warning, click advanced > proceed:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Select Nessus essentials and register with an email address to get an activation code to login and download plug-ins: <br/>

<br />
<br />
After downloading plug-ins, wait a few minutes for Nessus to compile plug-ins before creating a scan(uncredentialed scan):  <br/>

<br />
<br />
After plug-ins are done compiling, create a new scan > basic network scan > create scan name and input host IP address to scan. Save and Start the scan:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Wait a few minutes for Nessus to conclude the uncredentialed scan, observe only 1 medium vulnerability discovered with info being the things to look out for.:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
To conduct a credentialed scan, it's important to make a few changes to allow Nessus conduct this scan properly. First, we go to services > remote registry, enabling remote registry allows nessus to get access to registry and check for insecure configurations. we change this to automatic, apply changes and start:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Then we proceed to advanced sharing settings and enable file and printer sharing. After this, we access user account control and enable 'never notify':  <br/>

<br />
<br />
go to registry editor to further disable user account control: local machine>software>microsoft>windows>current version>policy>system then create a 'DWORD' called "localaccounttokenfilterpolicy" and set the value to 1, save and then restart machine:   <br/>

<br />
<br />
Go to my scans> select scan name> more> Configure> credentials > windows then input system username and password, save > go back to my scans > launch:   <br/>

<br />
<br />
Observe the credentialed scan detected more vulnerabilities on the Host, detecting 5 critical and 5 high severity vulnerabilities with a total of 62 vulnerabilities compared to the only 1 medium vulnerability and 14 total vulnerability detected by the uncredentialed scan:   <br/>

This goes to show the importance of vulnerability assessments and more importantly, credentialed scans to give an in-depth look at devices for vulnerabilities that threat actors can take advantage of to carry out malicious intents.
