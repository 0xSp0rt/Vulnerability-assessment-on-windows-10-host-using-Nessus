<h1>Vulnerability assessment on windows 10 host using Nessus</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project provides a guide on how to conduct uncredentialed and credentialed vulnerability assessment on a windows 10 host using Nessus essentials. Nessus is a vulnerability scanner used to scan for vulnerabilities in devices, operating systems, applications, cloud services and other network resources. The difference between a credentialed and uncredentialed vulnerability scan is the level of detail and in-depth vulnerability analysis provided by a credentialed scan. It is important to conduct these vulnerability scans as often as possible to detect and patch any new vulnerability that may exist.
